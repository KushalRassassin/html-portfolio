<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Kushal, a 20-year-old student in my final year of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at JSSSTU University. I'm on a journey of self-discovery, learning, and growth, and I'm excited to share a little bit about myself with you.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Passionate about Coding and AI</h2>
<p>My love for technology runs deep, and I'm particularly passionate about coding and innovative thinking in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Exploring the endless possibilities of AI and its applications in various domains truly fascinates me.</p>
<h2>Balancing Body and Mind</h2>
In addition to my academic pursuits, I believe in the importance of maintaining a healthy body and mind. You'll often find me hitting the gym, as physical fitness is something I prioritize. It helps me stay focused and energized, even when I'm tackling complex coding challenges.
<h2>Introverted but Enthusiastic</h2>


I'll admit it â€“ I'm a bit socially anxious and can be short-tempered at times. But that doesn't stop me from enjoying life. I love a good party, dancing to great music, and connecting with friends who share my interests.
<h2>Avid Reader and Lifelong Learner</h2>

When I'm not coding or working out, you'll likely find me immersed in a good book. Reading is my way of exploring new worlds and gaining valuable insights. Learning is a never-ending journey for me, and I'm always eager to expand my knowledge.
<h2>Embarking on an Exciting Career</h2>


I'm thrilled to share that I've recently been placed at an AI company as a software developer. This is a significant milestone in my journey, and I can't wait to contribute my skills and knowledge to the world of technology.
<h2>Looking for Love</h2>


On a personal note, I'm currently single and on the lookout for someone special. I believe that life is best enjoyed when shared with a partner who shares your values and dreams. So, if you're someone who's passionate about technology, enjoys a good conversation, and values personal growth, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's explore life's adventures together!

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. Feel free to connect with me on social media or drop me a message. I'm always up for a chat or a coding discussion!
